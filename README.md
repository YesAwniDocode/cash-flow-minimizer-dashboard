# Welcome to the Cash Flow Minimizer Dashboard README !!

This system minimizes the number of transactions among multiple banks in the different corners of the world that use different modes of payment. There is one world bank (with all payment modes) to act as an intermediary between banks that have no common mode of payment.

Getting Started
Let's take an example. say we have the following banks:

Bank_of_America (World bank)
Wells_Fargo
Royal_Bank_of_Canada
Westpac
National_Australia_Bank
Goldman_Sachs
Following are the payments to be done:
    Debtor Bank         Creditor Bank         Amount

Goldman_Sachs        Bank_of_America           Rs 100
Goldman_Sachs        Wells_Fargo           Rs 300
Goldman_Sachs        Royal_Bank_of_Canada       Rs 100
Goldman_Sachs        Westpac              Rs 100
National_Australia_Bank      Bank_of_America           Rs 300
National_Australia_Bank      Royal_Bank_of_Canada          Rs 100
Bank_of_America          Wells_Fargo             Rs 400
Wells_Fargo            Royal_Bank_of_Canada       Rs 200
Royal_Bank_of_Canada        Westpac              Rs 500
This is represented below as a directed graph with the directed edge representing debts.

But there's a catch!! Each Bank only supports a set of modes of payments and can make or receive payments only via those. Only World Bank suppports all modes of payments. In our current example we have only three payment modes :

Google_Pay
AliPay
Paytm
Following is the list of Banks and their supported payment modes :

Bank_of_America       -   Google_Pay, AliPay, Paytm
Wells_Fargo          -   Google_Pay, AliPay
Royal_Bank_of_Canada      -   AliPay
Westpac             -   Google_Pay, Paytm
Goldman_Sachs       -   Paytm
National_Australia_Bank       -   AliPay, Paytm
To pick the first Bank, we calculate the net amount for every Bank by using the below formula and store them in list:

net amount = [Sum of all credits(amounts to be received)] - [Sum of all debits(amounts to pay)]

Now the idea is that we are finding the bank which has minimum net amount(max debtor) (say Bank X, net amount x) and then finding the bank which has the maximum net amount( max creditor) (say Bank Y, net amount y) and also has a common payment mode (say M1) with the former bank. Then we find minimum of absolute value of x and y, lets call it z.
Now X pays the amount z to Y. Then 3 cases may arrived:

If (magnitude of x) < y => X is completely settled and so removed from the list.
If (magnitude of x) > y => Y is completely settled and so removed from the list.
If (magnitude of x) = y => X and Y both are completely settled and so both are removed from the list.
The same process is repeated for the remaining banks.
For the current example, the transactions for minimum cash flow are as follows:

So this is the required answer.

How to Use?
This system is completely menu-driven. So when you will run the C++ Application, it will guide you and show you the final output.
Below is the execution of our current example:

Thank you!! Happy learning and coding geeks :)
